## Implementation Guidelines

### Frontend Component Tests
1. Use React Testing Library
2. Focus on user interaction flows
3. Test both success and error paths
4. Include accessibility tests

### Transaction Tests
1. Create comprehensive test data sets
2. Test edge cases in categorization
3. Verify data consistency
4. Test all supported currencies

### Performance Tests
1. Create automated performance test suite
2. Define performance benchmarks
3. Monitor memory usage
4. Test with realistic data volumes

### Network Tests
1. Use network throttling in tests
2. Simulate various error conditions
3. Test retry mechanisms
4. Verify data integrity after failures

## Integration Testing Guidelines
1. Focus on API and Service Integration
   - Test API endpoints with different payloads
   - Verify service interactions and data flow
   - Test database operations and transactions
   - Validate business logic across services

2. Mock External Dependencies
   - Use consistent mocking patterns for bank APIs
   - Mock third-party services consistently
   - Maintain mock data fixtures
   - Document mocking strategies

3. Test Data Management
   - Use isolated test databases
   - Clean up test data between runs
   - Maintain data consistency
   - Version control test fixtures

## E2E Testing Guidelines
1. User-Centric Scenarios
   - Test complete user workflows
   - Verify frontend-to-backend integration
   - Include real-world use cases
   - Test cross-cutting concerns

2. Test Environment
   - Use dedicated E2E test environment
   - Reset application state between tests
   - Manage test data effectively
   - Control external dependencies

3. Stability and Reliability
   - Handle asynchronous operations
   - Implement retry mechanisms
   - Use stable test selectors
   - Monitor test flakiness

## Success Metrics
- 90%+ test coverage for new components
