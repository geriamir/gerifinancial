# RSU Vesting Timeline Rework - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The original RSU vesting timeline calculation had several critical issues:
1. **Arbitrary start date**: Timeline started from 1 year back with 0 value, ignoring historical context
2. **Missing sales integration**: Sales were not properly subtracted from accumulated value
3. **Flawed cliff logic**: Skipped events that hadn't reached 2 years, distorting the timeline
4. **Incorrect value calculation**: Mixed different pricing logic without proper event tracking
5. **No historical accuracy**: Timeline didn't reflect actual vesting/sale events and their real prices

## Solution: Event-Driven Timeline Generation

### Phase 1: New Timeline Service Architecture
Created `backend/src/services/timelineService.js` with the following approach:

#### Per-Grant Timeline Generation
- **Vesting Events**: Track each vesting date with actual stock prices
- **Sale Events**: Include all sales with their exact dates and prices
- **Tax Calculations**: Calculate taxes per grant at each event point
- **Price Tracking**: Use historical stock prices when available, with smart fallbacks

#### Portfolio Timeline Consolidation
- **Chronological Processing**: Events processed in actual chronological order
- **State Tracking**: Portfolio state carried forward through all months
- **Monthly Aggregation**: Combine events within same month while preserving detail
- **Accurate Accumulation**: Proper accounting for vesting gains and sale proceeds

### Phase 2: Enhanced Data Structure

#### PortfolioTimelinePoint Interface
```typescript
interface PortfolioTimelinePoint {
  date: string;
  month: string;
  monthKey: string;
  isHistorical: boolean;
  isFuture: boolean;
  isToday: boolean;
  events: TimelineEvent[];
  totalAccumulatedShares: number;
  totalAccumulatedValue: number;
  totalNetValue: number;
  totalTaxLiability: number;
  grantBreakdown: Array<{
    grantId: string;
    stockSymbol: string;
    company?: string;
    shares: number;
    value: number;
    netValue: number;
    taxLiability: number;
    isLongTerm: boolean;
  }>;
}
```

#### TimelineEvent Interface
```typescript
interface TimelineEvent {
  date: string;
  eventType: 'vesting' | 'sale';
  grantId: string;
  stockSymbol: string;
  company?: string;
  sharesVested?: number;
  sharesSold?: number;
  pricePerShare: number;
  isVested?: boolean;
  vestedValue?: number;
  saleValue?: number;
  taxCalculation?: TaxCalculation;
  grantDate: string;
  originalPricePerShare: number;
  accumulatedShares: number;
  accumulatedVestedShares: number;
  accumulatedValue: number;
  taxDetails: TaxDetails;
}
```

### Phase 3: Backend Implementation

#### New API Endpoints
- `GET /api/rsus/timeline` - Get portfolio timeline with timeframe support
- `GET /api/rsus/timeline/validate` - Validate timeline data integrity

#### Timeline Service Methods
- `generatePortfolioTimeline()` - Main timeline generation
- `generateGrantTimeline()` - Per-grant event processing
- `consolidatePortfolioTimeline()` - Portfolio-level aggregation
- `getHistoricalPrice()` - Smart price lookup with fallbacks
- `calculateAccumulatedTaxLiability()` - Accurate tax calculations

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration

#### Updated RSU Context
- Added timeline methods: `getPortfolioTimeline()`, `validateTimeline()`
- Integrated with existing error handling and loading states

#### Enhanced API Service
- New timeline API with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Support for different timeframes: 1Y, 2Y, 5Y, ALL
- Custom date range support

#### Reworked RSUVestingChart Component
- **Event-driven data**: Uses new timeline API instead of flawed calculation
- **Timeframe selector**: Toggle between 1Y, 2Y, 5Y, ALL views
- **Accurate tooltips**: Show proper event details with correct tax calculations
- **Historical accuracy**: Timeline starts from actual grant dates, not arbitrary lookback
- **Sales integration**: Properly shows impact of sales on portfolio value

### Key Improvements

#### 1. Historical Accuracy
- Timeline now starts from earliest grant date
- Uses actual vesting and sale dates with real market prices
- No more artificial "1 year back" starting point

#### 2. Proper Sales Integration
- Sales properly subtracted from accumulated value at correct timeline points
- Tax calculations account for actual sale proceeds
- Portfolio state accurately reflects remaining holdings

#### 3. Event-Driven Tax Calculations
- Taxes calculated per grant at each event
- Israeli tax rules properly applied (65% wage income + capital gains)
- Long-term vs short-term distinction based on actual holding periods

#### 4. Smart Price Handling
- Historical prices used when available (within 30-day window)
- Fallback to current prices for missing historical data
- Consistent price lookup across all timeline points

#### 5. Portfolio State Tracking
- Accurate accumulation of shares over time
- Proper handling of multiple grants and their interactions
- State carried forward through all months, not just event months

### Technical Benefits

#### Backend
- Clean separation of concerns (per-grant vs portfolio-level)
- Efficient database queries with proper filtering
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Timeline validation for data integrity

#### Frontend
- Responsive chart with accurate data visualization
- Better user experience with timeframe controls
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Type-safe API integration

### Result
The new timeline provides users with:
1. **True historical view** of RSU portfolio evolution
2. **Accurate tax implications** at each point in time
3. **Proper accounting** for vesting and sale events
4. **Realistic projections** based on actual grant terms
5. **Interactive exploration** with multiple timeframe views

This rework transforms the RSU timeline from a flawed reconstruction into an accurate, event-driven representation of portfolio evolution over time.
