  - Investment Health (0-100): Portfolio diversification and performance
  - RSU Health (0-100): Vesting timeline optimization and tax efficiency
  - Overall Score (0-100): Weighted combination with actionable insights
- **Trend Analysis**: Month-over-month and year-over-year health score progression
- **Benchmark Comparisons**: Anonymous peer comparisons for similar profiles

#### **Cross-System Alert System**
- **Proactive Notifications**:
  - "Large RSU vesting next month - update budget allocation?"
  - "Portfolio gains could fund vacation project budget"
  - "Budget surplus this month - increase investment contribution?"
  - "RSU concentration risk - consider diversification strategy"
- **Smart Timing Alerts**: Coordinate RSU sales, investment rebalancing, and project funding
- **Tax Optimization Alerts**: Year-end tax planning coordination across all systems

#### **Unified Timeline View**

### **Technical Architecture**
```javascript
// New Service: unifiedDashboardService.js
class UnifiedDashboardService {
  async calculateNetWorth(userId)
  async calculateFinancialHealthScore(userId)
  async getFinancialTimeline(userId, timeframe)
  async generateCrossSystemAlerts(userId)
  async getScenarioAnalysis(userId, scenarios)
}

// New Model: FinancialHealthScore.js
// New Model: UnifiedAlert.js
// New API Endpoints: /api/dashboard/unified/*
```

- **Project Feasibility Scoring**: Likelihood of project completion based on historical patterns
- **Financial Goal Achievement Probability**: Statistical modeling of goal achievement likelihood

### **Analytics Dashboard Components**
```typescript
// Advanced Analytics Widgets
interface AnalyticsWidget {
  totalReturnChart: TotalReturnAnalysis;
  correlationMatrix: CrossSystemCorrelations;
  scenarioPlanner: ScenarioAnalysisTools;
  predictiveInsights: FutureProjections;
  behaviorPatterns: FinancialBehaviorAnalysis;
