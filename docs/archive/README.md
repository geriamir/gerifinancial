# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical implementation summaries and documentation that are no longer actively referenced but are preserved for historical context.

## Archived Files

### Implementation Summaries
- **AVERAGING_DENOMINATOR_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md** - Backend refactoring of averaging denominator calculations
- **BACKEND_TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - Backend testing improvements and fixes
- **BUDGET_SERVICES_REFACTOR_SUMMARY.md** - Budget services refactoring implementation details
- **TEST_FIXES_SUMMARY.md** - General testing fixes and improvements

### Migration Documentation
- **BUDGET_SERVICES_MIGRATION_CHECKLIST.md** - Budget services migration checklist and procedures

### Completed Feature Documentation
- **ENHANCED_KEYWORD_MATCHING_PHASE1_SUMMARY.md** - Enhanced keyword matching Phase 1 completion summary
- **ENHANCED_KEYWORD_MATCHING_ROADMAP.md** - Enhanced keyword matching full roadmap (Phase 2 planning)
- **PATTERN_DETECTION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Pattern detection system implementation completion

## Why These Were Archived

These files were moved to the archive because:

1. **Implementation Complete**: The features they document have been fully implemented and integrated
2. **Superseded Documentation**: More comprehensive documentation exists in active roadmaps
3. **Historical Value Only**: They provide historical context but are not needed for current development
4. **Consolidation**: Information has been consolidated into main README.md and active roadmaps

## Current Active Documentation

For current project status and roadmaps, see:

- **README.md** - Main project documentation with current status
- **BUDGET_FEATURE_ROADMAP.md** - Comprehensive budget system documentation
- **PATTERN_DETECTION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - Current pattern detection status
- **ENHANCED_KEYWORD_MATCHING_PHASE1_SUMMARY.md** - Recent keyword matching improvements
- **TESTING_ROADMAP.md** - Current testing strategy and roadmap

## Access

These archived files remain accessible for:
- Historical reference during code reviews
- Understanding implementation decisions
- Learning from past approaches
- Maintenance and debugging of legacy components
