  - [x] Pagination (skip/limit)
  - [x] Consistent sorting by date (descending)
  - [x] Optional account filtering
  - [x] Response format with hasMore flag

### Frontend Structure

#### Component Hierarchy
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[TransactionsPage] --> B[FilterPanel]
    A --> C[TransactionsSummary]
    A --> D[TransactionsList]
