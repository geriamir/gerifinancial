# Transactions View Implementation Status

## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive transactions view with infinite scroll, filtering capabilities, and transaction management features.

## Technical Decisions

### Backend Changes

  - [x] Pagination (skip/limit)
  - [x] Consistent sorting by date (descending)
  - [x] Optional account filtering
  - [x] Response format with hasMore flag

### Frontend Structure

#### Component Hierarchy
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[TransactionsPage] --> B[FilterPanel]
    A --> C[TransactionsSummary]
    A --> D[TransactionsList]
    D --> E[TransactionRow]
    D --> F[InfiniteScroll]

   - [x] Search by description

3. [x] TransactionsList
   - [x] Infinite scroll implementation
   - [ ] Virtual scrolling for performance
   - [x] Loading states
   - [x] Empty states
   - [x] Error handling

4. [x] TransactionRow
   - [x] Display transaction details
   - [x] Category assignment
   - [ ] Expandable for more details
   - [ ] Status indicators

5. [ ] TransactionsSummary
   - [ ] Total Income
   - [ ] Total Expenses
   - [ ] Net Change
   - [ ] Category breakdown

### TypeScript Interfaces

```typescript
interface Transaction {
  _id: string;
  amount: number;
  currency: string;
  date: string;
  description: string;
  type: 'Expense' | 'Income' | 'Transfer';
  category?: Category;
  subCategory?: SubCategory;
  status: 'pending' | 'processed' | 'error';
}

interface TransactionListResponse {
  transactions: Transaction[];
  total: number;
  hasMore: boolean;
}

interface TransactionFilters {
  startDate: Date;
  endDate: Date;
  type?: 'Expense' | 'Income' | 'Transfer';
  category?: string;
  search?: string;
}
```

### API Integration
- [x] Add transactions API service

  - [x] Apply filters
  - [x] Update categories
  - [x] Error handling

### UI/UX Features
- [x] Responsive design

## Progress

### Completed
- Initial planning and architecture design
- Component hierarchy definition
- Basic TypeScript interface definitions:
  * Created transaction.ts with core interfaces
  * Created category.ts for categorization types
- Initial structure setup:
  * Created TransactionsPage component
  * Added route to App.tsx
- API Service Organization:
  * Split API services into separate modules (auth, bank, transactions)
  * Created base api.ts for shared configuration
  * Reorganized services directory structure:
    - Created api/ subdirectory for all API-related code
    - Moved all API files under api/
    - Created types/ subdirectory for shared types
    - Centralized type definitions in api/types/
    - Added clean exports through index.ts files
  * Updated all components to use new import paths
  * Improved code organization and maintainability
- Core Transaction Components:
  * TransactionsList with infinite scroll implementation
  * TransactionRow with currency/date formatting
  * Basic transaction filtering structure
  * Initial filters state management
- FilterPanel implementation:
  * Added date range picker with MUI Date Pickers
  * Added transaction type filter
  * Added search functionality with clear option
  * Added responsive layout
  * Added category filter with loading states
  * Added filter persistence with localStorage
