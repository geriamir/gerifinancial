## 3. Integration Points

### Scraping Integration
Both features integrate seamlessly with the existing israeli-bank-scrapers data:

```javascript
// Investment transactions from scraped data
if (scrapedData.investmentTransactions) {
  await investmentService.createInvestmentTransactions(
    userId,
    investmentId,
    scrapedData.investmentTransactions
  );
}

// Foreign currency accounts and transactions
if (scrapedData.foreignCurrencyAccounts) {
  await dataSyncService.processForeignCurrencyData(
    userId,
    bankAccountId,
    scrapedData.foreignCurrencyAccounts
  );
}
```

### Data Flow
1. **Scraping** → israeli-bank-scrapers extracts investment and foreign currency data
2. **Processing** → Backend services normalize and store the data
3. **API** → RESTful endpoints provide access to processed data
4. **Frontend** → React components display and manage the data

### Currency Handling
- Automatic ILS conversion for foreign currency balances
- Exchange rate tracking from multiple sources
- Consistent formatting across all currency displays
- Real-time conversion utilities

## 4. Testing and Validation

### Backend Testing
- Unit tests for all new models and services
- Integration tests for scraping workflows
- API endpoint testing with various data scenarios

### Frontend Testing
- Component testing for UI interactions
- Hook testing for data management
- End-to-end testing for complete workflows

## 5. Future Enhancements

### Investment Transactions
- Performance analytics and portfolio tracking
- Transaction categorization and tagging
- Export functionality for tax reporting
- Real-time price integration

### Foreign Currency
- Currency conversion calculator
- Exchange rate alerts and notifications
- Multi-currency portfolio analysis
- Historical rate charting

## 6. Documentation

All components and services include comprehensive JSDoc documentation with:
- Parameter descriptions and types
- Usage examples
- Error handling information
- Integration guidelines

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully adds support for both investment transactions and foreign currency accounts from the updated israeli-bank-scrapers package. The solution provides:

- **Complete backend infrastructure** for data processing and storage
- **Full API coverage** for all operations
- **Rich frontend components** for user interaction
- **Seamless integration** with existing codebase
- **Extensible architecture** for future enhancements

Both features are now ready for production use and provide a solid foundation for enhanced financial tracking capabilities.
